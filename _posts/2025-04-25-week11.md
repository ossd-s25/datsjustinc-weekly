title: Week 11, Second Explorations & Presentation Prep
---

We're settling into the final push of the semester. This week was about starting our second Oppia exploration and wrapping it up, all while starting to organize slides for next week's final presentation. It's a steady rhythm of planning, building, and rehearsing.

## Getting Started on Exploration Two

Jumping into the second exploration feels more familiar. Having the first one almost finished gives us a clear roadmap, so we can spend more time on experimentation:

- **Light conversational cues**: We're using brief character remarks--more like a nudge than a punchline--to keep the tone approachable.  

- **Accessibility reviews**: We're running drafts through a screen reader and tightening up our descriptions to ensure clarity.

The team's workflow feels smoother now that we know what to expect.

## Slide Deck Development

We've begun sketching out slides that go beyond bullet lists. Early versions include \simple annotations, and a few diagrams of our planning process. In our quick run-throughs, we're noticing:

- It's easier to talk about why each design choice mattered than to memorize every detail.  
- Charts help us stay on track, especially when we sync on the narrative flow.  
- A draft agenda slide keeps the presentation from feeling too scattered.

These rehearsal snippets help highlight where we need to refine timing or clarify transitions.

## Small Moments, Big Ideas

Mid-week, someone asked, "What if we let learners revisit a previous question and try again?" That simple question led to a short brainstorm on feedback loops. It's a reminder that small, open-ended prompts can spark useful adjustments.

## Looking Forward

Next week, we'll publish the second exploration, polish the slide deck, and settle into full rehearsal mode. It's a balance of tying up loose ends and staying flexible for last-minute improvements. Here's to a productive Week 12.
