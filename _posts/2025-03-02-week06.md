title: Week 6, My Contributions So Far
---

Contributing to open source has been something I've wanted to do more consistently, and while I haven't made a ton of contributions yet, I'm starting to find my footing. This past month, I made a couple of small contributions, and I'm hoping to pick up the pace this week.

## What I've Done So Far

**OpenStreetMap Contribution (Jan 28, 2025)**

This was a simple but useful edit--I updated a location's status to permanently closed. Small updates like these help keep maps accurate, and while it might not seem like much, it can make a difference for someone relying on OpenStreetMap for directions.

A lot of these projects require a hefty adjustment period before even making a small contribution. It's not just about fixing a bug or adding a feature--you first have to dig through documentation, understand the project's structure, and sometimes learn new technical concepts just to get started. Even "newbie-friendly" issues often assume a certain level of familiarity with the codebase, which can make onboarding feel slow and overhwleming.

**OSSD Course Logistics (Feb 12, 2025)**

This was a minor spelling fix in an HTML file for the open-source software development course. Not the most groundbreaking change, but attention to detail matters, and fixing small errors keeps documentation clean and professional.

## Challenges And Plans Moving Forward

One of the biggest challenges so far has been just getting started--finding the right projects and figuring out where I can contribute meaningfully. It's easy to get stuck in the mindset of wanting to make a big impact right away, but I'm realizing that small contributions are a great way to get comfortable with the process.

This week, I want to start contributing more consistently. Wikipedia edits seem like a good way to get into the habit of making small but valuable contributions. I'm also looking at beginner-friendly open-source projects where I can get some hands-on experience, whether that's fixing documentation, addressing small bugs, or even just engaging in discussions.

## Most Proud Contribution?

Honestly, I don't have a standout contribution yet, but I'm proud of the fact that I've taken the first steps. Every contributor starts somewhere, and even if it's just a map edit or a spelling fix, it's still a step toward something bigger. The goal now is to build momentum and start tackling more involved contributions outside of Open Street Maps and the OSSD Course Website Repository.
