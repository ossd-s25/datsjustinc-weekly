title: Week 2, Why Open-Source Projects Have A Code of Conduct
---

Hey there, back again with a blog post for week 2. This time, our discussion centers around why big open-source projects have a code of conduct. To me, it's more than just a set of rules. Having a code of conduct helps create a welcoming, productive environment where developers from all backgrounds can collaborate without fear of harassment or exclusion.

## Go Project

<em>Take the Go Project for example. Its code of conduct has three key goals listed right at the start of the page:</em>

**1. Setting a baseline for respectful communication.**

**2. Providing a system to resolve conflicts.**

**3. Ensuring diversity and inclusivity, recognizing that Go thrives on contributors from all backgrounds.**

Unlike many generic guidelines, the Go Project has a dedicated investigation team and allows anonymous reporting for safety. This helps maintain fairness while keeping the community constructive.

## But How Does Go's Code Of Conduct Differ From Other Big Open-Source Projects Like The Contributor Covenant?

Instead of focusing on broad values like "kindness," [Go's version](https://go.dev/conduct) emphasizes patient and thoughtfulness, even advising contributors to avoid sensitive discussions and could derail productive conversations. For example, it has a structured conflict resolution process, something the Contributor Covenant lacks. 

However, the [Contributor Covenet](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/) is more of a widely used template for other open-source projects. Listed on their page is a list of projects that have adapted their code of conduct--projects like Eclipse.

## So Let's Take A Look At Eclipse's Approach And Compare Its Structure And Content To That Of Go's.

[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php) has a much stricter enforcement for their code of conduct. Just some key differences that I found:

**1. No bias in investigations: if an Eclipse staff member is the subject of a complaint, they're removed from the process to ensure fairness. Go's policy doesn't explicitly prevent bias like this.**

**2. Detailed investigation steps: Eclipse outlines exactly how violations are handled, ensuring due process.**

**3. No retaliation clause: reporters are explicitly protected from backlash, so they don't fear being silenced.**

<em>Eclipse's stricter approach makes sense--it's a larger organization with legal considerations, whereas Go is a more community-driven project.</em>


## Let's Take A Look At the Code Of Conduct For The Open-Source Project, Sugar Labs.

This one is an interesting example. Unlike Go's structured approach, [Sugar Lab's code of conduct](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs:Privacy_policy) focuses on collaboration and respect, encouraging contributors to seek help and consult others before making major changes. It shares some similarities with the Contributor Covenant, showing how many projects build upon existing guidelines rather than reinventing it.


## An Open-Source Project that I've Been Interested In Recently Is The Godot Engine. 

Let's take a look at [Godot's code of conduct](https://godotengine.org/code-of-conduct/) and see how it ompare swith others, like the Go Project and Eclipse. Its code of conduct is structed aroud kindness, inclusivity, and cooperation. It highlights:

**1. Politeness and positive intent: acknowledging cultural differences and encouraging constructive feedback.**

**2. Zero tolerance for discrimination or harassment: with emphasis on making industry minorities feel welcome.**

**3. Consensus-driven decision-making: features are approved through agreement among contributors before moving forward with a proposal.**

**4. Clear reporting mechanisms: a dedicated team, including multiple contact options, is available for handling violations. A key feature is that retaliation against reporters is explicitly prohibited, ensuring safety for those who raise concerns.**

Godot's code of conduct encourages open discussions and consensus, wheras Go's approach is more structured and focused on maintaining technical efficiency.

Eclipse, however, takes a more stricter stance than both Godot and Go because it is more legally structured. While Eclipse's corporate structure means clear enforcement policies are critical, Gadot's maintains a community-first approach with real human interpretation of rules. 

## Some Final Thoughts

A code of conduct isn't just about rules. It helps define a project's culture. I think that, ultimately, having a cler and fairy policy benefits everyone, making open-source a better place for all.
