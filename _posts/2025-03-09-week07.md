title: Week 7, Diving Into OPPIA
---

So, we finally picked our open-source project--OPPIA! After tossing around a few ideas, our group landed on it because of its strong educational focus and active community. Plus, it seemed like a great project to get our hands on with real-world open-source contribution.

## First Steps

Our first meeting (3/8) was all about getting set up--making sure everyone could actually run the project on their devices. Sounds simple, right? Well... not exactly. One of our group members managed to get everything up and running. Some of us had issues getting the dev environment to build properly, but we're chipping away at those problems, troubleshooting together, and leaning on OPPIA's documentation and community for help.

## Next Steps

For our second meeting (3/9), we're switching gears to understanding how to contribute properly. We'll be reviewing all the necessary contribution guidelines, templates, and best practices to make sure we're all aligned. The goal is to avoid messy PRs and unnecessary roadblocks later. Basically, we want to do things right from the start.

Even though we hit a few bumps early on, it's been solid teamwork so far. We're figuring things out as we go, helping each other where we can, and making sure no one gets left behind. Excited to see where this project takes us!
