title: Week 4, Reflections on This Week's Git Exercises and Group Presentations
---

This week's class covered Git exercises, group presentations, and some interesting extension projects from different teams. It was a good mix of hands-on practice, teamwork, and seeing how everyone approached problem-solving in their own unique way.

## Git Exercises

I was able to follow along with the Git exercises pretty well. As a game design major, I've been working with Git and GitHub since freshman year, so things like branches, merge conflicts, and handling remote repositories I already have some experience with. That being said, I still found the brief overview and demonstration helpful--sometimes, even the basics are good to revisit. One new thing I learned was using git restore, which I hadn't really used before. Definitely a useful command to keep in mind!

## Group Presentation and Planning

I think our presentation went well overall. We organized an outline, assigning slides to make sure everyone knew their part, and making sure we had a solid structure. We even got to class early to do a quick run-through, which helped with voice projection and making the delivery smoother. One thing we did that I highly recommend is setting up a timer during practice--this made sure we didn't go way under or over the time limit. It's ssomething I've done a lot in my game design classes, and it really helps keep things on track.

## Other Group Presentations

It was great to see what other groups came up with. Everyone put in effort in different ways-some had well-structured slides/presentations, others took a more casual approach, and there was a nice variety in the types of projects. Some extensions had clear real-world functionality for work or education, while others were more lighthearted, cute, or just funny. I liked seeing that mix--it showed creativity from different angles, and even if not every idea was super practical, they were all interesting in their own way.

## Biggest Takeaway

For me, the biggest takeaway from this project was the teamwork aspect. In my game design major, group work is constant--almost every class involves short-term or long-term projects with regular presentations. But in my computer science courses, I haven't seen nearly as much emphasis on that. This project really highlighted how important it is to communicate, adapt to different skill levels, and work towards a common goal. It was a nice change of pace and a good reminder that technical skills alone aren't enoughh--you also need to be able to collaborate effectively.

Overall, it was a solid week, and I'm looking forward to seeing how future projects evolve!
