title: Week 10, Open Source & Claude Warren
---

This week brought a mix of excitement and that end-of-semester scramble. Our Oppia exploration project is finally clicking into place--after wrestling with outlines and skill-table layouts, we're seeing our community lessons take shape. I also squeezed in Claude Warren's DevWorld 2024 talk, "The Cathedral, the Bazaar, and the Coffee House," and it got me thinking about how code, process, and those casual "coffeehouse" moments all feed into a healthy open-source vibe.

## Our Project So Far

Over the past couple of weeks, our team has been planning and storyboarding our first community exploration for Oppia. We started by diving into Oppia's content guidelines--figuring out how to structure a lesson that's both interactive and learner-centered. We sketched out a narrative arc that guides a learner and weaves in real-world examples. Next, we mapped out the skill table--breaking down each mini-skill the lesson needs to teach--and linked them into a skill tree that shows learners how each concept builds on the last. Even while we wait for voice-over approvals, we're drafting sample voice-over scripts to slot right into the exploration editor.

The real fun has been blending question prompts, worked-out solutions, and story snippets into a seamless flow. Our goal is that learners never feel like they're just clicking through a quiz--they're on a journey.

## A Look Into Claude Warren's Talk

Claude opened by pointing out that just tracking licenses or running vulnerability scans only gets you halfway there. What really makes the difference is weaving team conversations and community check-ins into your everyday workflow--so you catch problems before they blow up.

Then he pulled out the "coffee house" image--think 17th-century London cafes where merchants swapped the latest shipping tips over a cup of joe--to show how those informal drop-in chats spark the little lightbulb moments that formal meetings often miss. His big idea? Bookend your busy calendars with casual Slack huddles, open office hours, or a rotating "OSPO coffee chat" so the human side of open source never goes cold.

## Bridging Cathedral & Bazaar

Raymond's Cathedral vs. Bazaar essay contrasts big-bang, milestone-driven releases with the "release early, release often" ethos of bazaar-style development. In our Oppia work, we've gravitated between both: we lock down a lesson outline in doc sprints (Cathedral), then open it up for branching contributions--scripts, question variations, voice-over tweaks (Bazaar). Adding Warren's Coffee House lens means we're also scheduling quick "campfire" calls where anyone on the team can bring up road blocks, depencendies, or pitch a fresh idea.

## OSPO Spotlights

#### Google's OSPO
Chris DiBona and team built Google's OSPO to handle everything from Summer of Code to license strategy. They run docs sprints, mentor first-time contributors, and keep hundreds of internal teams connected to the wider OSS ecosystem.

### Microsoft's OSPO
Over at Microsoft, a cross-functional OSPO squad (including Emma Irwin) runs the FOSS Fund, hosts regular community calls, and builds "Component Intelligence" dashboards so dev teams know exactly which upstream projects they rely on--and how healthy those projects are.

### Red Hat's OSPO
Red Hat embeds its OSPO right in the Office of the CTO. Brian Proffitt and Deborah Bryant focus on community health metrics, standards-body liaison, and onboarding new projects under Red Hat's open-source umbrella--keeping that community pulse strong.

## Motivation And Looking Ahead

Open source isn't just code or content--it's the conversations, the chance encounters, and those extra little moments over coffee that turn good projects into great ones. It keeps our exploration journey as lively, iterative, and human as possible.
